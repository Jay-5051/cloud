#PATH
---
 There are two types of *path names* used in linux:

1.Absolute Path

2.Relative Path Name 

---

**Absolute Path Name**
        An Absolute Path Name begins with the root directory and follows the tree branches until the path to the desired file/directory
is completed.
eg:- `\home\ec2-user\directory`

---

**Relative Path Name**
        In Relative Path Name mostly two symbols are used :
1. `.`  -> current directory / working directory 

2. `..` ->working directories parent directory 

Relative Path starts from working directory.
eg:- `cd .` gives current directory , `cd ..` gives parent directory of current directory.
